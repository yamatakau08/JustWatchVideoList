# JustWatchVideoList

This script gets the video list from "JustWatch" website.
I wrote the study of Selenium.

Note that on this script on Windows 7 use the chromedriver for Selenium::WebDriver::for :chrome
chromedriver 2.35.528161 (5b82f2d2aae0ca24b877009200ced9065a772e73) works fine
but chromeDriver (v2.9.248315) doesn't work

The page scroll enables the 1500 title video.
